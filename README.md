Hi, I’m @jav-kidcarlomagno
I’m interested in economics, demographics and NFL, I really love that!
I’m currently learning Python for data science, in the future I would like to learn and use AI.
I’m looking to collaborate on projects about data science.
You can find me at the following email: jjarioria@gmail.com
